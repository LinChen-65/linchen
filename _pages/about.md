Hello / 你好 / 안녕하세요! 

I am currently a PhD candidate and HKPFS awardee at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) advised by [Prof. Pan Hui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Hui). Previously, I was a visiting researcher at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Yong Li](http://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/), and a visiting researcher at Knowledge Lab, University of Chicago, advised by [Prof. James Evans](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/james-evans). 


# Research Interest
My research interests lie in data science, urban science, computational social science, and graph neural networks. Currently, I mainly focus on human mobility networks, urban inequality, segregation, and urban resilience.
